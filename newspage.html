                <h3>Fashion for the Future</h3>
            </header>

            <p>This week, I am <em>extremely excited</em> about a new sustainable fashion technique called <dfn>sustainable dyeing</dfn>.
            In sustainable dyeing, natural plant-based dyes are used instead of harmful chemicals. In his book, <cite>Fashion and Sustainability</cite>, John Smith describes it as <q>an eco-friendly revolution in the fashion industry.</q></p>

            <p>Next month, we will be showcasing a line of clothing using <em>natural, organic dyes</em>. To reserve your spot at our exclusive virtual event, contact us before <time datetime="2024-10-31">October 31</time>.</p>

            123-456-7890</p>

            <p><strong>Warning:</strong> Some natural dyes may fade over time. Be sure to follow care instructions closely!</p>
